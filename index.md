## About Me

I am a senior-year undergraduate student in the CSIE department at National Taiwan University.
I've had the pleasure of collaborating with Prof. [Shang-Tse Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~stchen/) and Prof. [Hsuan-Tien Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/).
Currently, I am a visiting student at the [CompLING Lab, University of Waterloo](https://compling-wat.com/),
working with Prof. [Freda Shi](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fhs/).

In terms of research focus, I have worked on improving the [adversarial robustness](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2019/all-adversarial-example-papers.html) of vision models.
Broadly, I am interested in understanding the underlying mechanisms of machine learning models, with the goal of contributing to the development of trustworthy and powerful AI/ML systems.
