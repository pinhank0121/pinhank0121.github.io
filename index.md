## About Me

I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from National Taiwan University (NTU) in August 2025.
During my studies, I've had the pleasure of collaborating with Prof. [Shang-Tse Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~stchen/) and Prof. [Hsuan-Tien Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/). I was also a visiting student at University of Waterloo, where I worked with Prof. [Freda Shi](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fhs/).

I am interested in understanding the undesirable behaviors of ML models and advancing the trustworthiness of AI systems.
